# A first look into the linux world

You may soon realise that you're now entering a field where we're generally looking at a command line. Don't worry, you'll soon get very used to it and learn to love it. ðŸ˜„

[There are good reasons to use a terminal](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) insted of GUI's (graphical user interfaces), but I will assume that if you're here you already have a slight idea about that. 

For now I will only leave this quote here:

> I once heard an author say that when you are a child you use a computer by looking at the pictures. When you grow up, you learn to read and write. 

Also, here are some articles explaining the basics of using a unix terminal, if you're new to this world:
